P1 - pcollins

zsort takes required two arguments to run:
	i
		the input binary file to read and sort which can be created with generate
	o
		the output sorted binary file to write which is human-readable with dump

use "gcc -Wall -o zsort zsort.c"
note sort.h is a required dependency for compilation
